## Project Description
**Project Name:** EcoCode - Where Sustainability Meets Code

**Description:**
EcoCode is an exciting project that brings together two seemingly different worlds: environmental sustainability and computer programming. Our motivation is simple - we want to inspire people to care more about the environment and empower them to take real eco-friendly actions, all while having fun with coding!

**Motivation:**
The world is facing critical environmental challenges, and it's high time we all pitched in to make a difference. EcoCode is our way of making sustainability cool and accessible. We believe that by merging coding with real-time environmental data, we can make a big impact and encourage everyone to be more eco-conscious.

**Potential Project Phases:**

1. **Blockly API Made Easy:** First, we'll dive into the Blockly API, a tool that simplifies coding for beginners. This step will make sure that EcoCode is super user-friendly.

2. **Eco-Action Building Blocks:** The heart of EcoCode is its library of eco-action blocks. Think of these like Lego pieces for saving the planet! Users can pick and choose from these blocks to create their own eco-action plans.

3. **Weather Data for Context:** We're planning on adding a cool feature where you can see real-time weather data. It helps you make eco-action plans that make sense for your location and current conditions.

4. **Helpful Guides and Tutorials:** We know coding can be intimidating, especially for newcomers. So, we'll plan on making detailed guides and tutorials to make sure everyone can use EcoCode effectively. We're all about sharing knowledge!

**Main Goals:**
1. **Boost Environmental Awareness:** EcoCode's main aim is to help you understand and care more about environmental issues. By using real-world data, it shows you the direct impact of your eco-actions.

2. **User-Friendly:** We're making sure EcoCode is super easy to use, even if you've never coded before. We want everyone to be able to join the sustainability party!

3. **Collaboration and Learning:** EcoCode is all about teamwork! You can share your eco-action plans and learn from others. Together, we can make a real change for the environment.

In a nutshell, EcoCode is not just a coding project; it's a community-driven initiative to make the world a greener, better place. So, join us on this exciting journey to code for a brighter, more sustainable future! 


**How EcoCode Relates to Parsing, Interpretation, and Compilation:**

EcoCode isn't just about programming; it's about applying the fundamental concepts of parsing, interpretation, and compilation in a unique way that contributes to a more sustainable world. Parsing comes into play as EcoCode analyzes and breaks down each eco-action into understandable "blocks," making complex sustainability ideas digestible for everyone. Interpretation is at the core of our project as it translates these blocks into actionable eco-plans, considering real-time environmental data. Compilation, in the context of EcoCode, involves combining these plans into executable sets of eco-actions. In essence, EcoCode's parsing, interpretation, and compilation processes facilitate the translation of environmental awareness into concrete, personalized actions, offering a dynamic bridge between technology and sustainability for users of all backgrounds.

# Blockly JavaScript Code Generator - EcoCode

This project provides a graphical interface using Google's Blockly to allow users to design custom logic. It then generates JavaScript code based on the designed logic.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Navigate to the `milestone1` directory or the 'main' directory.

## Running the Blockly Interface

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Design your logic using the available blocks.
3. Click the "Generate JavaScript Code" button to view the generated JavaScript code.
4. Optionally, click the "Save Code" button to download the generated code as a `.js` file.

## Additional Information
1. The custom blocks are defined in the `custom_blocks.js` file.
2. The `index.html` file provides the main interface for interacting with Blockly and generating JavaScript code.
