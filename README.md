Sure, I can help create a more visually appealing layout for your README. I'll organize the content into sections with improved formatting. Note that while I can provide a text-based layout, implementing it with actual styling (like specific fonts, colors, or interactive elements) would require HTML/CSS or Markdown formatting, which you would need to apply in your actual README file.

## Project Description
**EcoCode** is an innovative project that combines environmental sustainability with computer programming. Our aim is to encourage eco-friendly actions through the engaging world of coding.

### Motivation
As the world grapples with environmental challenges, EcoCode seeks to make sustainability both cool and accessible, using coding and real-time environmental data.

### Project Features
- **Custom Blocks in EcoCode:**
  - **Electricity Emissions Estimate:** Calculate carbon emissions from electricity based on location.
  - **Flight Emissions Estimate:** Estimate air travel emissions.
  - **Shipping Emissions Estimate:** Determine carbon footprint of shipping methods.
  - **Text Input Block:** For enhanced user interaction.
  - **Notification System:** Engage users with custom message notifications.

### Interactive Elements and Event Listeners
EcoCode uses interactive elements and event listeners for a dynamic user experience, like toggling element visibility based on user actions.

### Main Goals
- **Enhancing Environmental Awareness:** Using interactive and real-world data.
- **User-Friendly Experience:** Accessible and intuitive design.
- **Promoting Collaboration and Learning:** Encouraging shared eco-actions and learning.

### Relation to Parsing, Interpretation, and Compilation
EcoCode applies these concepts to transform environmental awareness into actionable plans, incorporating real-time data for a personalized approach.
