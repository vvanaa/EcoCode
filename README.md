## Project Description
**Project Name:** EcoCode - Where Sustainability Meets Code

**Description:**
EcoCode is an exciting project that brings together two seemingly different worlds: environmental sustainability and computer programming. Our motivation is simple - we want to inspire people to care more about the environment and empower them to take real eco-friendly actions, all while having fun with coding!

**Motivation:**
The world is facing critical environmental challenges, and it's high time we all pitched in to make a difference. EcoCode is our way of making sustainability cool and accessible. We believe that by merging coding with real-time environmental data, we can make a big impact and encourage everyone to be more eco-conscious.

**Project Features

***Custom Blocks in EcoCode
EcoCode features several custom Blockly blocks, each designed to engage users in environmental awareness and action:

1.  **Generate Electricity Emissions Estimate:** Users can calculate the carbon emissions from electricity consumption based on location-specific data.
2.  **Generate Flight Emissions Estimate:** This block allows users to estimate emissions from air travel, taking into account factors like the number of passengers, airports, cabin class, and more.
3.  **Generate Shipping Emissions Estimate:** Users can determine the carbon footprint of various shipping methods, considering weight, distance, and transport type.
4.  **Text Input Block:** A simple block for entering text, enhancing user interaction within the platform.
5.  **Notification System:** An innovative feature where users can input their email, name, and a custom message to send notifications, fostering user engagement and communication.

##Interactive Elements and Event Listeners
** EcoCode incorporates interactive elements and event listeners to enhance user engagement. For example, toggling the visibility of certain elements in response to user interactions provides a more dynamic experience.

**Main Goals:**
- **Enhancing Environmental Awareness**: EcoCode is dedicated to increasing understanding and concern for environmental issues through interactive and real-world data integration.
- **User-Friendly Experience**: With a focus on accessibility, EcoCode is designed to be intuitive and approachable, even for those new to coding.
- **Promoting Collaboration and Learning**: The platform encourages sharing of eco-action plans and collaborative learning, driving collective environmental change.


**How EcoCode Relates to Parsing, Interpretation, and Compilation:**

EcoCode isn't just about programming; it's about applying the fundamental concepts of parsing, interpretation, and compilation in a unique way that contributes to a more sustainable world. Parsing comes into play as EcoCode analyzes and breaks down each eco-action into understandable "blocks," making complex sustainability ideas digestible for everyone. Interpretation is at the core of our project as it translates these blocks into actionable eco-plans, considering real-time environmental data. Compilation, in the context of EcoCode, involves combining these plans into executable sets of eco-actions. In essence, EcoCode's parsing, interpretation, and compilation processes facilitate the translation of environmental awareness into concrete, personalized actions, offering a dynamic bridge between technology and sustainability for users of all backgrounds.

# Blockly JavaScript Code Generator - EcoCode

This project provides a graphical interface using Google's Blockly to allow users to design custom logic. It then generates JavaScript code based on the designed logic.

## Relating to Parsing, Interpretation, and Compilation
EcoCode uniquely applies parsing, interpretation, and compilation concepts to promote sustainability. It parses complex sustainability concepts into user-friendly blocks, interprets these into actionable plans considering real-time data, and compiles them into executable eco-friendly strategies.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Navigate to the `milestone1` directory or the 'main' directory.

## Running the Blockly Interface

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Design your logic using the available blocks.
3. Click the "Generate JavaScript Code" button to view the generated JavaScript code.
4. Optionally, click the "Save Code" button to download the generated code as a `.js` file.

## Additional Information
1. The custom blocks are defined in the `custom_blocks.js` file.
2. The `index.html` file provides the main interface for interacting with Blockly and generating JavaScript code.
